### Programming contest
- AtCoder
    - New coder friendly website, and a lot of interesting problems. Mainly working on resolving B, C, D of the ABC contests right now.
- CodeForces
    - Good website, it might be confusing for new coders. It has a massive problemset to track your process. I'm only participating to Div2-4 contests. 
- Here are the list of websites I stopped to use
    - Leetcode
        - Good to practice before real interviews. But stopped to work on that.
    - Google Codejam
        - I personally recommend this website, but some questions are very tricky.
    - Google Kickstart
        - Good resources. But Google stopped to support this. 
    - Binarysearch
        - I think this website just stopped at some point of time. And it's similar to Leetcode, good website to practice before interviews.
